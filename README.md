# sign-up-form
In this project, I've created a modern and interactive sign-up form using HTML, CSS with Flexbox, and JavaScript.

Highlighted Features:

  1.User-Friendly Design: The sign-up form is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing. It utilizes Flexbox for responsive layout and dynamic content arrangement.

  2.Password Validation: The JavaScript component of the form provides real-time password validation. It checks whether the password meets specific security requirements, including a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and a length between 6 and 20 characters.

  3.Password Confirmation: The form includes a password confirmation field that is compared with the original password to ensure accuracy. If the passwords do not match, an error message is displayed to guide the user.

  4.Input Validation: The project incorporates input validation to ensure that all required fields are filled before submitting the form. Error messages are displayed in real-time to inform users about any incomplete or incorrect entries.
